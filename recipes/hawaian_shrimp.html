    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're a garlic lover, you'll want to pull out your bucket list and add this recipe to it. I absolutely love this, and I think you will, too. Serve it over white rice with fresh lemon wedges</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head garlic</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 pound frozen large deveined, shell-on shrimp, thawed
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate garlic cloves into a bowl; place another bowl on top. Shake until all peels separate from cloves, about 30 seconds, being careful not to shake too hard. Mince garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a sauté pan over medium heat; add minced garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Pat thawed shrimp dry with paper towels; add to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine rice flour, paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle over shrimp and toss until completely coated using a large spoon or spatula.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer, in batches, and cook until browned and just barely cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add some garlic butter; cook for 30 seconds more. Repeat with remaining shrimp and garlic butter. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
